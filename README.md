Idle Clicker TUI Game.  With Ants.


## IDEAS

Click food
Food buys `Ants`
`Ants` gather food
First upgrade: Queen (unlocks `Workers` [Food], 2x `Ants` production)
`Workers` gather Sticks
Sticks buy upgrades:
  Stilts (unlocks `Haulers [Food + Sticks]`)
  Pack Frame (2x `Workers` production [Sticks])
Stilts unlock purchasing `Haulers` (Food + Sticks)
`Haulers` gather Rocks
Rocks buy upgrades:
  Wheels (2x `Workers`/`Haulers` production [Food + Sticks + Rocks]) -- EXPENSIVE
  Clubs (unlocks `Soldiers [Food + Sticks + Rocks]` [Sticks + Rocks])
`Soldiers` gather Land (mm of land)
Land buys upgrades:
  Farming (2x `Ants` production [Food + Land])
  Quarry  (2x `Haulers` production [Sticks + Rocks + Land])
  Outposts (2x `Soldiers` production [Food + Sticks + Land])
TODO:  WHAT NEXT?

- Popup toast message each time something is unlocked
  - Might need a queue of messages so a large group of unlocks doesn't spam the screen 
- "Prestige" is colonization of new planet.  Old planet(s) are "shipping" food to the new planet, providing the prestige multiplier
