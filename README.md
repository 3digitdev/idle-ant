## IDEAS

Click food
Food buys Ants
Ants gather food
First upgrade: Queen
Queen unlocks purchasing Workers
Workers gather Sticks
Sticks buy first upgrade: Stilts
Stilts unlock purchasing Haulers (Food + Sticks)
Haulers gather Rocks
Rocks buy second upgrade: Wheels (early) -- upgrade for Haulers/Workers
Rocks buy third upgrade: Clubs
Clubs unlock purchasing Soldiers (Food + Sticks + Rocks)
Soldiers gather Land (mm of land)
Land buys upgrade: Farming (Food + Land) -- upgrade for Ants
TODO:  WHAT NEXT?

- Popup toast message each time something is unlocked
  - Might need a queue of messages so a large group of unlocks doesn't spam the screen 
- "Prestige" is colonization of new planet.  Old planet(s) are "shipping" food to the new planet, providing the prestige multiplier
